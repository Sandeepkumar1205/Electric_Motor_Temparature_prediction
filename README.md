# Electric_Motor_Temparature_prediction_ML

Electric Motor Temperature Prediction using Machine Learning
Project Overview
Electric motors are widely used in industrial applications, and overheating can lead to performance degradation, equipment failure, and increased maintenance cost.
This project uses Machine Learning techniques to predict the rotor temperature of an electric motor based on historical sensor data such as voltage, current, motor speed, and stator temperatures.

The trained model is deployed using a Flask web application that allows users to predict motor temperature through a manual input interface and demonstrates a future-ready sensor-based prediction module.
